In this world, everything is fully roaming around AI and other algorithms; moreover, the majority of the internet is fully made by bots. I am fully circled with algorithms, and I am busted out like anything. But the good thing is that I became a master at controlling them after analyzing them for 4 to 5 years on my device.

With this article and Questions I would like to highlight about Algorithm’s change…! As algorithm tries to know more about us, It should know more about our goals and get us into proper shape to reach our goals.

Well Many people didn’t get a thought about this or else, busy in engaging with you phone….

```markdown
Before elaborating more about it, let's come back to Q & A!

--> Are you taking advantage of the internet?

--> Is social media giving you full advantage or disadvantage?

--> Are you stuck in the social media loop?

--> Have you ever thought about why your recommendations are bad?

--> Do you think they are bad, or are you bad at controlling recommendations?

--> I think you got boredom with my questions…!

```

Situation: This is the main thing.
I am a big fan of YouTube. I love watching it more often, and at one point in time, it gives me many new business and intelligence thoughts. YouTube is my knowledge environment and also my entertainment. Many people ask me how I will enjoy it! I simply say YouTube, and people, I know how you are figuring out about me.

But fun a side... Oops, I think there is no fun in it. Chill,  let’s come back to track! Exactly after a few years, I realized how YouTube is going about giving recommendations to users based on their watch history.
Now the actual question to ask in this situation is, "Is the algorithm giving you the right recommendations?

I want to be your savior with this superb writeup.
Isn't it true that we all consume a lot of content on social media? But question yourself: is that what you need? Your answer is NO, for sure.

# Assumption_1
Assume you have a life goal to win something, and to fill that goal, you will watch a number of things and grasp them where ever possible by thinking that they will be useful in the future. Maybe even I will do the same.

For a while to be stress-free.….
Assume you watch some videos about fun on the Internet. There you go. The algorithm starts stopping you or brags back about your dream of winning something in life and gives you more funny videos than you need!

This should be raised and questioned to you yourself first and then to companies next. Any way, companies will follow and talk about their private policies and things about which we don’t care at all, so answering to ourselves will give some pretty good conclusions.

Now, to come to a conclusion, you should ask yourself, What should I watch to make algorithm activity better?
